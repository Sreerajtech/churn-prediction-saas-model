# ðŸ§  Customer Churn Reduction Strategy â€“ SaaS Subscription Model

This project implements a full-cycle machine learning pipeline to predict customer churn using the IBM Telco dataset. It integrates model interpretability, fairness handling, and business-focused retention strategies to support subscription-based SaaS growth.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

* Predict customer churn using advanced classification algorithms
* Enhance model interpretability through SHAP value analysis
* Provide actionable recommendations to reduce churn and boost customer lifetime value (CLV)

---

## ðŸ“¦ Project Components

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
* **Feature Engineering**: CLV estimation, contract length, interaction variables
* **Bias Mitigation**: SMOTEENN for class imbalance handling
* **Models Used**: XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, and Ensemble modeling
* **Evaluation Metrics**: ROC-AUC, F1 Score
* **Model Explainability**: SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
* **Interactive Deployment**: Streamlit web app for real-time predictions

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Results Summary

* âœ… **Ensemble ROC-AUC Score**: *0.84+*
* âœ… **Top Predictive Features**:

  * `MonthlyCharges`
  * `Contract`
  * `Tenure`
  * `CLV`
  * `OnlineSecurity`
